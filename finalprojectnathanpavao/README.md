I had to overcome many challenges during the process of building this site. I couldn't center the contact form and had trouble getting the entire site to be reponsive as well. It was very stressful. The designs i have on my site and in the xd file are images I edited myself but the original picture credits of the players go to their respective/rightful owners. I learned that creating a portfolio website isn't as easy as it seems and that lots of time goes in to dealing with screw ups and other errors you have along the way.
